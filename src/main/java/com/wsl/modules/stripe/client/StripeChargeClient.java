    /**
     * Create a Charge
     * 
     * @param amount A positive integer in the smallest currency unit (e.g 100 cents to charge $1.00, or 1 to charge Â¥1, a 0-decimal currency) representing how much to charge the card. The minimum amount is $0.50 (or equivalent in charge currency).
     * @param currency 3-letter ISO code for currency 
     * @param customerId The ID of an existing customer that will be charged in this request.
     * 					either source or customer is required
     * @param source A payment source to be charged, such as a credit card. If you also pass a customer ID, the source must be the ID of a source belonging to the customer. Otherwise, if you do not pass a customer ID, the source you provide must be a Map containing a user's credit card details. Although not all information is required, the extra info helps prevent fraud.
     * @param description An arbitrary string which you can attach to a charge object. It is displayed when in the web interface alongside the charge. Note that if you use Stripe to send automatic email receipts to your customers, your receipt emails will include the description of the charge(s) that they are describing.
     * @param metadata A set of key/value pairs that you can attach to a charge object. It can be useful for storing additional information about the customer in a structured format. It's often a good idea to store an email address in metadata for tracking later.
     * @param capture Whether or not to immediately capture the charge. When false, the charge issues an authorization (or pre-authorization), and will need to be captured later. Uncaptured charges expire in 7 days. For more information, see authorizing charges and settling later.
     * @param statementDescriptor An arbitrary string to be displayed on your customer's credit card statement. This may be up to 22 characters. As an example, if your website is RunClub and the item you're charging for is a race ticket, you may want to specify a statement_descriptor of RunClub 5K race ticket. The statement description may not include <>"' characters, and will appear on your customer's statement in capital letters. Non-ASCII characters are automatically stripped. While most banks display this information consistently, some may display it incorrectly or not at all.
     * @param receiptEmail The email address to send this charge's receipt to. The receipt will not be sent until the charge is paid. If this charge is for a customer, the email address specified here will override the customer's email address. Receipts will not be sent for test mode charges. If receipt_email is specified for a charge in live mode, a receipt will be sent regardless of your email settings.
     * @param destination An account to make the charge on behalf of. If specified, the charge will be attributed to the destination account for tax reporting, and the funds from the charge will be transferred to the destination account. The ID of the resulting transfer will be returned in the transfer field of the response. See the documentation for details.
     * @param applicationFee A fee in cents that will be applied to the charge and transferred to the application owner's Stripe account. To use an application fee, the request must be made on behalf of another account, using the Stripe-Account header, an OAuth key, or the destination parameter. For more information, see the application fees documentation.
     * @param shipping Shipping information for the charge. Helps prevent fraud on charges for physical goods.
     * @return Returns the created Charge.
     * @throws StripeConnectorException when there is a problem with the Connector
